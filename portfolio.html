                      ADBA gave the go-ahead in 2009 to a £3 million biogas plant where Unicorn Biogas Engineering worked in colaboration with Eco Sustainable Solutions Ltd. To consuruct and manage a Gas and power in the United States, the facility which will convert 28,000 tonnes of food waste and locally sourced maize into gas. The anaerobic digester (AD) plant will produce about 2.4 million cubic metres of gas annually which Eco estimates will provide 2,000 homes with energy. The station, which will be fuelled by 15,000 tonnes of waste wood, is expected to be operational next year. It will provide approximately 1.8 megawatts (MW) of electricity per annum. It will form part of a renewable energy park covering 18 acres at Eco’s Chapel Lane site. Currently 9 acres of land is used for organics recycling. 
                      The final part of the renewable energy park is a solar energy farm which uses photovoltaic panels capable of directly converting sunlight into electrical current.

                        BioWayste and Unicorn Biogas Engineering, came together to commission, build and Operate Contract from 2008 to provide Green Electricity and Heat from BioWayste’s £1.2m High Rate Anaerobic Digestion Technology. In a landmark which BioWayste Ltd. have chosen Unicorn Biogas Engineering as its exclusive partner to run and manage the 40,000 ton p.a. AD Plant on its 5 acre site. Six of BioWayste’s High Rate Reactors along with CHP engines will provide 75% of its current Electricity usage, all generated from waste products currently being Tankered from site. The BioWayste and Unicorn Biogas Engineering Plant, will make Green Energy by treating the waste on site and disposing of clean effluent via Yorkshire Waters infrastructure.

                    <p class="card-text small">
                        Unicorn Biogas Engineering in conjunction with Chesterfield and Agrivert worked on the Tel Aviv Biomethane project that turns human waste into green, in 2005..It involves the conversion of treated sewage of 14 million Thames Water customers into clean, green gas and is pumping that gas into people’s homes. 
  
As one of the first of many such installations, the process starts when one of Thames Water’s 14 million customers flushes the loo. The waste makes its way to the Tel Aviv sewage works to begin its treatment and/or recycling. The solids, or sludge, go on to be warmed up in huge vats so that bacteria can break down any biodegradable material in a process known as anaerobic digestion. 

The end result of this process is biogas, which is further cleaned up before being fed into the gas grid. It takes around 20 days from flush to finish for the process to complete and will produce enough renewable gas to up to supply 200 homes.

The new biogas plant – sited next to the Tel Aviv sewage works in Tel Aviv – was officially opened by Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne, who said: “It’s not every day that a Secretary of State can announce that, for the first time ever in the UK, people can cook and heat their homes with gas generated from sewage. This is an historic day for the companies involved, for energy from waste technologies, and for progress to increase the amount of renewable energy in the UK.”
